Overview
========
The usart_9bit_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use usart driver in 9-bit mode in multi-slave system.
Master can send data to slave with certain address specifically, and slave can only receive data when it is addressed.

In this example, one usart instance is used with address configured. Its TX and RX pins are connected together.
First it sends a piece of data out, then addresses itself, after that sends the other piece of data. Only data
sent after the address can be received by itself.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.30.1
- Keil MDK  5.37
- MCUXpresso  11.6.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  10.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso51U68 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UART2    CONNECTS TO       	  	  UART2
Pin Name   FC2_P0_9     	 	  Pin Name  FC2_P1_14
TXD        J2-13               	  RXD       J2-1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J6) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the CMSIS DAP terminal like:

UART 9-bit mode example begins
UART is configured with address, only data sent to itself after matched address can be received
UART will send first piece of data out:

0x 0  0x 1  0x 2  0x 3  0x 4  0x 5  0x 6  0x 7  
0x 8  0x 9  0x a  0x b  0x c  0x d  0x e  0x f  

UART will address itself
UART will send the other piece of data out:

0x10  0x11  0x12  0x13  0x14  0x15  0x16  0x17  
0x18  0x19  0x1a  0x1b  0x1c  0x1d  0x1e  0x1f  

UART received data:

0x10  0x11  0x12  0x13  0x14  0x15  0x16  0x17  
0x18  0x19  0x1a  0x1b  0x1c  0x1d  0x1e  0x1f  

All data matches!
